[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LogPusher/logpusher-dotnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LogPusher/logpusher-dotnet.svg?branch=master)


LogPusher is a system that allows you to receive notifications through your mobile on a single application. 
Apart from push notifications, you can also receive information without a mobile client via SMS and Mail service. 
You can integrate with any software through the API.
